#  Project Statement – Student Result Management System

## Problem Statement
In many colleges and schools, teachers still manage student results manually, which often leads to errors, data loss, and difficulty in retrieving marks quickly. There is no simple way for faculty to store multiple students' details, update their marks, or view their overall performance in one place.  
To solve this problem, a basic Student Result Management System is needed that can store student information, calculate results, and display them in an organized and error-free manner.

##  Scope of the Project
The system will allow teachers or administrators to add new student records, enter marks for different subjects, calculate total/average, and easily display the results whenever required.  
The scope is limited to a console-based Java application that implements clean OOP concepts and maintains data temporarily using appropriate data structures.

##  Target Users
- Teachers  
- Academic staff  
- Small coaching centres  
- Students who want to quickly check their results  

## High-Level Features
- Add new student details (name, roll number, subjects, marks)  
- Store and manage multiple student result records  
- Automatically calculate total marks and average  
- Display the complete result sheet of all students  
- Simple menu-driven system for easy navigation
