# Student Result Management System

This is a simple and beginner-friendly *Student Result Management System* made using Java.  
I built this project as part of my course requirement to understand how to apply OOP concepts,  
modular coding, and real-world workflows.

The main idea of the project is to help manage basic student result information like  
adding a student, entering marks, calculating results, and displaying them in a clean format.

## Features

### Add Student  
You can add a new student with:  
- Roll number  
- Name  
- Subject marks  

### View All Students  
Shows a list of all students along with their marks and result status.

### Calculate Result  
Automatically checks total marks and prints:  
- Pass  
- Fail  
- Percentage  

### Update / Modify Marks  
If required, marks of a particular student can be updated.



## Concepts Used
- Java OOP (Classes, Objects, Constructors)  
- ArrayList for storing student data  
- Functions/methods for modularity  
- Simple validation  
- Menu-driven console workflow  

These helped me understand how real systems organize data in a structured way.

## Why I Built This Project  
To practice basic Java skills and understand how an actual system manages student information.  
This project helped me learn:  
- How to break a big problem into modules  
- How to handle user input  
- How to organize classes properly  
- How to maintain and update stored data
